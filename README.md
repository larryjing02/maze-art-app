# maze-art-app
This is an Android application that runs 24/7 on a tablet attached to my desk.
Continually regenerates a random maze using the randomized Prim's algorithm approach, then solves it with A* (see [`FullscreenActivity.java`](https://github.com/larryjing02/maze-art-app/blob/92a90de525119cece03590278d5fbd14a0c74bb6/app/src/main/java/com/example/mazedisplay/FullscreenActivity.java).
This piece of art invites us to consider the balance between creation and resolution, as it continuously generates and solves a complex maze. It encourages us to reflect on the ways in which we navigate the twists and turns of life, and to consider the choices we make as we seek to find our way through the many challenges we face.
